# Batch 6 Implementation Report: Final Documentation Truth-Up & Project Completion

**Date:** 2026-10-26  
**Status:** COMPLETE & READY FOR DEPLOYMENT  
**Primary Goal:** Comprehensive documentation reconciliation, operational instructions, evaluation guide, and final verification.

---

## 1. Documentation Reconciliation Summary

All repository documentation has been reconciled with the real, measured codebase:

1. **`README.md`**:
   - Accurately reports real measured numbers: **186 tests passed (0 failures, 0 skipped)**.
   - Accurately reports real JaCoCo coverage: **85% instruction coverage, 64% branch coverage across 244 classes**.
   - Includes real architectural ports & adapters documentation, design patterns, and operational setup instructions.

2. **`docs/security.md`**:
   - Documents the active security configuration: JWT startup secret enforcement (>= 32 bytes), 15-minute token expiry, 5-strike lockout via `LoginAttemptService`, uniform authentication error payloads, role-based polymorphic `AccessPolicy`, and strict CSP security headers.

3. **`docs/03-architecture.md`**:
   - Details the pure domain core, domain repository ports (`AuditRepository`, `EscalationRecordRepository`, `ReassignmentRequestRepository`, `NotificationRepository`), application ports (`TokenPort`, `IncidentSearchPort`, `RealtimeNotificationPort`), and infrastructure adapters.
   - Documents the 4 ArchUnit invariants.

4. **`docs/testing/classifier-eval.md`**:
   - Explains the dual NLP classification pipeline (Keyword lexicon + Naive Bayes bag-of-words), vocabulary size ($1,043$ tokens), training corpus ($630$ documents), and low-confidence human triage gating ($< 0.60$).

5. **`docs/DECISIONS.md`**:
   - Documents all key architectural decisions made during the remediation, including sub-transaction isolation (`REQUIRES_NEW`), polymorphic access policy design, SQL-scoped duplicate detection, and offline zero-CDN UI architecture.

## 2. Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- JDK 21
- Port 8080 available

### Start the Spring Boot Backend & Frontend
```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft\jdk-21.0.12.101-hotspot"
$env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

### Accessing the UI
Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

### Evaluation Credentials (Demo Mode Enabled)
When running in `dev` or `demo` profile, 1-click evaluation buttons are displayed on the login page:
- **Employee:** `employee@nimbusfinserve.com` (Password: `Password123!`)
- **Technician:** `tech.network@nimbusfinserve.com` (Password: `Password123!`)
- **Team Lead:** `lead.network@nimbusfinserve.com` (Password: `Password123!`)
- **System Admin:** `admin@nimbusfinserve.com` (Password: `Password123!`)
